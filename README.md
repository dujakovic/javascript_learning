# Mini-projects I've made while learning JavaScript

First project is simple and rather weird calculator. I don't need to explain much: 1) user types a value and selects which operation does he want 2) pressing the button of wanted operation, user gets an output result of entered value and value before that

Second project is a primitive game. User can attack and strong-attack opponent. But after every action, opponent attacks user, even if he heals himself. Opponent's attack is more powerful than user's, but user has an extra life which he gets if he loses. The last option is writing to log. With that option user can have a peek in every battle-cycle, or after every action: what are the values of each action (attack, heal ...) and other parameters.
